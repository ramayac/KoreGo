# Phase 11a — Lower Priority Improvements

> **Status:** Backlog | **Depends on:** Phase 11 complete or in progress

---

## Context

These items improve quality, robustness, and production-readiness but are not blocking for the core value proposition. Address after Phase 11 priorities are shipped.

---

## 11a.1 — Compliance Test Suite Expansion

**Current state:** Only 3 Bash compliance scripts exist (`test_ls.sh`, `test_cat.sh`, `test_basename_dirname.sh`). 46 utilities have no dedicated compliance tests. Regressions outside BusyBox coverage are invisible.

### Tasks

- [ ] Write compliance test scripts for all 49 utilities under `test/compliance/`
- [ ] Each script should: test the happy path, at least one edge case, and `--json` output validity
- [ ] Wire all scripts into `make compliance` (currently only runs 3)
- [ ] Add a CI step that fails on compliance test failure (no `continue-on-error`)

### Template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test/compliance/test_grep.sh
set -euo pipefail
KOREGO=${KOREGO:-./korego}

echo "hello world" | $KOREGO grep "hello"  # exit 0
echo "hello world" | $KOREGO grep "xyz" && exit 1 || true  # exit 1 expected
out=$($KOREGO grep --json "hello" <(echo "hello world"))
echo "$out" | jq -e '.matches | length > 0'
echo "PASS: grep"
```

## 11a.2 — Missing Unit Tests

**Current state:** 8 packages have no dedicated `_test.go` file: `client`, `cp`, `ln`, `mv`, `rmdir`, `yes`, `pkg/daemon`, and `pkg/common` (partial).

### Tasks

- [ ] `pkg/cp` — test copy file, copy directory recursively, overwrite behavior
- [ ] `pkg/mv` — test rename, cross-device move, overwrite
- [ ] `pkg/ln` — test hard link, symlink creation, `-f` force
- [ ] `pkg/rmdir` — test empty dir removal, non-empty rejection
- [ ] `pkg/yes` — test output pattern, `-n` limit (if implemented)
- [ ] `pkg/daemon` — test daemon startup, socket creation, graceful shutdown
- [ ] Enforce a minimum coverage gate in CI (suggest 70% per package if possible, with both positive and negative tests)

---

## 11a.3 — Shell Interpreter Security Model

**Current state:** `internal/shell/interpreter.go` wraps `mvdan.cc/sh` with a 30s timeout and memory limit (per `wiki/07_agent_features.md`), but there are no tests for these limits and no documentation of the security boundaries.
This timeout is configurable via `KOREGO_SHELL_TIMEOUT`, but it's not clear to users what the default is or why it exists. Additionally, if the shell is intended to be safe for untrusted input, that should be explicitly stated and tested.

### Tasks

- [ ] Write tests that verify timeout is enforced (e.g., `sleep 60` must be killed)
- [ ] Write tests that verify dangerous operations are blocked (if sandboxing is intended)
- [ ] Document the security model in `docs/SECURITY.md`:
  - What can a script access? (filesystem, env, network)
  - What are the resource limits?
  - What syscalls are blocked (if any)?
- [ ] Decide and document whether `korego.shell.exec` is "trusted input only" or "untrusted input safe"

## 11a.4 — CI Quality Gates

**Current state:** Several CI checks are informational and don't fail the build.

| Check | Current | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| BusyBox suite | `continue-on-error: true` | Fail on regression from baseline |
| Image size | Warn if >20MB | Fail if >20MB |
| Coverage | Not enforced | Fail if <70% on changed packages |
| Compliance tests | 3 scripts only | All 49 utilities |

### Tasks

- [ ] Change BusyBox CI step to fail if pass count drops below 479 (current baseline)
- [ ] Make image size gate a hard failure
- [ ] Add `go test -coverprofile` with a threshold check (`go-coverage-report` or similar)
- [ ] Add compliance test step that runs all scripts from 11a.1

---

## 11a.5 — Makefile Improvements

**Current state:** Several targets are missing or broken for non-Mac environments.

### Tasks

- [ ] Add `make bench` target wired to `test/benchmark/` (currently exists but not in Makefile)
- [ ] Fix `make cover` — currently opens HTML in browser; add `make cover-pct` that prints % only and is CI-friendly
- [ ] Add `make validate-schemas` target (prereq for Phase 11.1)
- [ ] Add `make example-agent` target (prereq for Phase 11.2)
- [ ] Document all targets in a `make help` target

---

## 11a.6 — Deployment Patterns

**Current state:** No deployment documentation beyond the basic Docker quickstart in README.

### Tasks

- [ ] `docs/deploy/docker-compose.md` — daemon as a sidecar alongside an app container
- [ ] `docs/deploy/kubernetes.md` — daemon as an init container or sidecar, with Unix socket shared via `emptyDir` volume
- [ ] `docs/deploy/systemd.md` — unit file for running the daemon on a Linux host
- [ ] `examples/docker-compose.yml` — working example from the docs

---

## 11a.7 — Release Pipeline Hardening

**Current state:** GoReleaser builds multi-arch binaries and pushes to GHCR, but no supply chain security measures are in place.

### Tasks

- [ ] Add SBOM generation to GoReleaser config (`sboms: true`)
- [ ] Add SLSA provenance attestation (GitHub Actions `slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator`)
- [ ] Add container image signing (Cosign)
- [ ] Add `trivy` or `grype` container scanning step in CI
- [ ] Auto-generate CHANGELOG from conventional commits on release

---

## 11a.8 — Clean Up `scratch.go`

**Current state:** `scratch.go` at the repo root contains a standalone Myers diff implementation with its own `main()` function. It is not imported anywhere and appears to be leftover scratch work.

### Tasks

- [ ] Verify it is not referenced anywhere (`grep -r "scratch" .`)
- [ ] Delete `scratch.go`

---

## Milestone 11a

- [ ] All 49 utilities have compliance test scripts and CI runs them
- [ ] 8 missing unit test files added; coverage gate enforced in CI
- [ ] `make help`, `make bench`, `make validate-schemas` all work
- [ ] `docs/SECURITY.md` documents the shell interpreter threat model
- [ ] `scratch.go` deleted
- [ ] At least one deployment pattern documented with a working example
