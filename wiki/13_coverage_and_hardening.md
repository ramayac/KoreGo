## Part A — Code Audit Summary

Code-level evidence gathered during the live-repository audit. Cross-referenced
against wiki claims and the [Gold roadmap](12_road_to_gold.md).

**Overall coverage at time of audit: 41.6%** (`go test -coverprofile` across `./pkg/...` `./internal/...`)

### Gap Summary

| # | Gap | Status |
|---|-----|--------|
| 13.0 | macOS build breakage (`uname`, `stat`, `client`) | ✅ Fixed |
| 13.1 | No supply chain security (SBOM, Cosign, SLSA, Trivy) | ✅ Fixed |
| 13.2 | Shell security model undocumented, untested | ✅ Fixed |
| 13.3 | Coverage gate was informational only | ✅ Fixed (≥70% enforced in `Makefile` via `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD`) |
| 13.4 | BusyBox CI/local discrepancy (testing system BusyBox, not GoPOSIX) | ✅ Fixed |
| 13.5 | `awk` not implemented (Platinum gate) | ⏳ Open — [07a_awk.md](07a_awk.md) |

Details for each gap are recorded in the [Gold roadmap](12_road_to_gold.md)
(12.0–12.5). This document focuses on the **action plan** going forward.

## Part B — Focus Areas

Post-Gold, work concentrates on five pillars:

| Pillar | Target | Primary Doc |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | 75% overall (from ~50%) | This document |
| **POSIX** | 99%+ BusyBox pass rate, zero regressions | [posix_coverage.md](posix_coverage.md) |
| **Security** | Hardened shell, supply chain, SBOM, secured defaults | [08_hardening.md](08_hardening.md), [docs/SECURITY.md](../docs/SECURITY.md) |
| **Speed** | <1ms daemon latency, <15MB binary, <100ms CLI startup | This document |
| **Docker** | Usable `FROM scratch` image, smoke-tested, signed | [09_release_docs.md](09_release_docs.md) |

---

## Part C — Coverage Policy & CI Gate

### CI Enforcement

```makefile
# Makefile
COVERAGE_THRESHOLD := 70
```

`make ci` runs `make cover-gate` which hard-fails (`exit 1`) if overall coverage drops below 70%.
This is the single source of truth — any other document claiming a different threshold is stale.

### Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall coverage | **70.5%** |
| CI gate threshold | **70%** (hard fail) |
| Packages below 5% | 0 |
| Packages at ≥80% | 25+ |

### Verification

```bash
make cover-pct          # Prints overall coverage percentage
make cover-pkg          # Per-package breakdown
make cover-gate         # Hard-fails if <70%
make ci                 # Full pipeline including cover-gate
```

## Part D — Historical Coverage Ramp Plan (retained for reference)

> The ramp plan below was written when coverage was 41.6%. Coverage is now 70.5% —
> exceeding the original 60% and 68% targets. The remaining unchecked items are
> deferred improvements, not blocking issues.

### Root Cause

Every package follows the same arch: a public `Run()` (library layer, testable with
`io.Reader`/`io.Writer`) and a private `run()` (CLI glue that calls
`common.ParseFlags()`, opens real files, binds `os.Stdin`/`os.Stdout`). Tests
overwhelmingly cover `Run()` but skip `run()` entirely.

```
grep:          354 total LOC, 240 in run() →  86.3%  ✅ (refactored: grepRun injectable)
head:          181 total LOC, 130 in run() →  94.1%  ✅ (headInput struct, 3 bugs fixed)
internal/daemon: 613 total LOC             →  19.1%  (up from 3.3%; posix-json tests)
tee:            66 total LOC,  44 in run() →  72.5%  (improved since audit; was 3.3%)
```

### Stage 1 — Critical Foundations (50% → 60%)

#### 1.1 `internal/daemon` (19.1% → 35%)

**Why first:** 613 LoC. Handles all RPC dispatch, Unix socket lifecycle, session
management, rate limiting, observability. This is the backbone of daemon mode.
Already improved from 3.3%→19.1% via posix-json integration tests (Phase 14c).

- [ ] `server_test.go` — `processRequest` error paths, `handleBatch` edge cases, graceful shutdown
- [ ] `session_test.go` — lifecycle: Create/Get/SetCwd/List/Destroy, TTL expiry
- [ ] `ratelimit_test.go` — verify existing, cover `Allow()` edge cases

**Est. gain:** +3.2% overall, ~400 test LOC.

#### 1.2 `cmd/goposix` (0% → 50%)

- [ ] `main_test.go` — Extract `runMain(args []string) error`. Test: symlink dispatch,
  subcommand mode, `--list-commands`, `--help`, `--version`, missing subcommand.

**Est. gain:** +0.5% overall, ~80 test LOC.

#### 1.3 `pkg/client` (45% → 60%)

- [ ] `client_helpers_test.go` — Integration with real in-process Unix socket.
  `Cat()`, `Echo()`, `Pwd()`, `Stat()`, `Ls()`, `Ping()`, `Dial()` error path,
  `Close()`, `WithTimeout()`, `WithMaxRetries()`.

**Est. gain:** +1.5% overall, ~250 test LOC.

#### 1.4 `pkg/daemon` (6% → 40%)

- [ ] `daemon_test.go` — Socket creation, SIGTERM/SIGINT graceful shutdown,
  `--socket` flag path.

**Est. gain:** +0.3% overall, ~60 test LOC.

---

### Stage 2 — Utility CLI Layer (60% → 68%)

Close the `run()` gap via dispatch-call tests using `testdata/` fixtures.

**Pattern:**

```go
func TestRunViaDispatch(t *testing.T) {
    cmd := dispatch.Lookup("grep")
    var out bytes.Buffer
    exitCode := cmd.Run([]string{"-c", "Alice", "testdata/alice.txt"}, &out)
}
```

### Stage 3 — Refactor & Harden (68% → 75%)

- [x] **`pkg/grep/`**: Extract `run(args, stdout, stderr io.Writer, stdin io.Reader) int` ✅ `grepRun()`
- [x] **`pkg/tar/`**: Extract create/extract/list into testable functions ✅ `createArchiveStream()`, `extractArchiveStream()`, `listArchiveStream()`
- [ ] **`pkg/sed/`**: Extract `compileScripts()` and `runEngine()` from file I/O ✅ `compileAst()` already extracted; engine is testable via temp files — refactoring deferred (low ROI, existing structure adequate)
- [ ] **`pkg/find/`**: Extract `parsePredicates()` as pure function ✅ existing `getMaxDepth()`/`buildExecArgs()` are pure; `run()` parses inline — refactoring deferred (no testability gap)
- [x] **Tooling**: Add `make cover-pkg` target; CI gate at 60% hard-fail ✅ `make cover-pkg` and `make cover-gate` added; `make ci` includes `cover-gate`
- [x] **Docs**: Coverage policy in AGENTS.md ✅ Section 4a added

## Part E — Speed Targets

| Metric | Current | Target | How |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Binary size | ~15 MB | <12 MB | `-ldflags="-s -w"`, UPX, dead code elimination |
| Docker image | ~17 MB | <10 MB | `COPY --from=build /out/bin /bin` only |
| Daemon latency | <5ms | <1ms | Keep hot path allocations minimal; `sync.Pool` for buffers |
| CLI startup | ~10ms | <5ms | Avoid `init()` heavy lifting; lazy flag parsing |
| `go test -race` | Pass | Pass (maintain) | All tests must pass race detector |
