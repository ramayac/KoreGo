# Security Model

## Trust Level

The `korego.shell.exec` RPC method is designed for **trusted input only**. Scripts executed
through this interface run with the same OS-level privileges as the daemon process. The
sandboxing below is a defense-in-depth measure, not a guarantee against a determined
adversary with arbitrary code execution.

If you expose the daemon socket to untrusted clients (e.g., over a network), you must
implement authentication and authorization in front of it — the daemon itself has no
auth layer.

## Accessible Resources

### Filesystem

Scripts can access the filesystem subject to path confinement via `SecurePath`:

- When a session has a working directory (CWD) set, file opens are restricted to that
  subtree. Path traversal (`../../../etc/passwd`) is blocked.
- When CWD is `/` or unset, the entire filesystem is accessible.
- Symlinks are followed; the resolved target must also be within the allowed path.

### Environment Variables

Scripts inherit a caller-specified environment. By default, no environment variables
are set. Callers can inject specific variables via the `env` parameter.

### Network

**No network access.** The shell interpreter (`mvdan.cc/sh`) is configured without
networking capabilities. Scripts cannot make outbound connections or listen on ports.

### Process Execution

Scripts can invoke KoreGo utilities (the same ones available via the multicall binary)
and any external commands available in the container/VM. On a `FROM scratch` Docker
image, only KoreGo utilities are available.

## Resource Limits

| Resource | Limit | Configurable |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Execution timeout | 30s default | `KOREGO_SHELL_TIMEOUT` env var (Go duration format, e.g. `60s`, `5m`) |
| Stdout buffer | 128 MB | No (hardcoded `LimitWriter`) |
| Stderr buffer | 128 MB | No (hardcoded `LimitWriter`) |

When the timeout expires, the script is terminated via context cancellation and receives
a non-zero exit code. When either output buffer is exceeded, the stream is truncated.

## RPC-Level Protections

| Protection | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Max request body size | 1 MB |
| Max RPC requests/sec per connection | 100 (configurable) |
| Connection limit | Configurable max concurrent connections |
| Session TTL | Automatic cleanup of idle sessions |

## Recommended Deployment Posture

1. **Run as non-root.** The Docker image uses `USER korego (1000:1000)`. Never override
   this without a specific reason.
2. **Socket permissions.** The Unix socket should be owned by the daemon user with `0600`
   or `0660` permissions. Restrict access to a specific group.
3. **No network exposure.** Use Unix domain sockets, not TCP. If TCP is unavoidable, place
   a reverse proxy with authentication in front of the daemon.
4. **Minimal base image.** Use the `FROM scratch` production image. It contains only the
   KoreGo static binary — no shell, no package manager, no utilities.
5. **Read-only filesystem.** Mount the container filesystem as read-only except for the
   socket directory and any paths the daemon needs to write to.
6. **Session isolation.** Use sessions (`korego.session.create`) for multi-step workflows.
   Sessions confine file operations to a working directory. Stateless calls operate
   against `/` by default.

## Artifact Verification

*(Supply chain security — tracked in Phase 12.1)*

Once implemented, release artifacts will be signed via Cosign and include SLSA Level 3
provenance. SBOMs will be attached to container images. Verify with:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/ramayac/korego:latest \
  --certificate-identity-regexp='.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer='https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com'

docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/ramayac/korego:latest --format '{{ json .SBOM }}'
```
